# AnimeFaceNFT

## Goal
This repository is created to test NFT contracts and test Opensea's UX

## Expected Use Case
* Metadata    : Stored in IPFS
* Minter      : Only the owner of this contract
* MarketPlace : Opensea

## Contracts
* Based on ERC721 contract code from Openzeppelin
* Overwrite _baseURI() to make it easier to access IPFS (we should register only IPFS hash when mint NFTs)
* Overwrite isApprovedForAll() to enable Opensea to Transfer NFTs in this contract
* Only the owner of this contract can mint NFTs
* The owner can list URIs of all NFTs from this contract

## Setup
```
$ npm install
$ npx hardhat
```
1. apply to [Polygonscan API](https://polygonscan.com/register) and [Etherscan API](https://etherscan.io/apis)
2. install [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=ja)
3. fill token to your wallet from [faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/) or CEX
4. register to [Infura](https://infura.io/) and "create project" to get "project id" => fill { INFURA_PROJECT_ID } at ./hardhat.config.js
5. run above codes
6. create `.env` file as below
```
PRIVATE_KEY={ SECRET_KEY_OF_YOUR_METAMASK_WALLET }
ETHERSCAN_API_KEYS={"hardhat":"", "mumbai":"{ POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY }", "rinkeby": "{ ETHERSCAN_API_KEY }"}
```

## Customize
Line 13 of `./contracts/AnimeFaceNFT.sol` file is the name of the NFT collection that your contract issues. Please rewrite "AnimeFaceNFT" or "AFN" as you like.

## Test
`npx hardhat test`

## Deploy
```
$ npx hardhat run --network { Network Name } scripts/deploy_animefacenft.js
$ npx hardhat verify --network { Network Name } { Contract Address }
```

## Set image and metadata files on IPFS storage using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/)
1. [Register](https://app.pinata.cloud/register)
2. [Get API Key](https://app.pinata.cloud/keys) if you'd like to use it
3. Upload image file and pin it on Pinata â†’ Get "hash"
4. Create Metadata JSON file as below using "hash" from 3rd operation
```JSON
{
  "description": "{ Description of this NFT }",

  "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/{ IPFS HASH }", 
  "name": "{ Name of this NFT }",
  "attributes": [ ... ], 
}
```
5. Upload JSON from "4" and get its hash for metadata

## Setup the React client app
```
$ cd mintApp
$ npm install
```
* open `mintApp/src/chain.json` and fill the informations
```chain.json
{
    "CHAIN_NAME": "{ CHAIN_NAME }",             // as you like
    "CHAIN_ID": "{ CHAIN_ID }",                 // decimal integer (mumbai: 5, rinkeby: 4)
    "HEX_CHAIN_ID": "{ HEX_CHAIN_ID }",         // hex integer (mumbai: 0x5, rinkeby: 0x4)
    "TOKEN": "{ TOKEN_SYMBOL }",                // token name (mumbai: MATIC, rinkeby: ETH)
    "RPC": "{ RPC_ENDPOINT }",                  // RPC Endpoint
    "EXPLORER": "{ EXPLORER_URL }",             // explorer address
