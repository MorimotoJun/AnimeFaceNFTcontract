# AnimeFaceNFT

## Goal
This repository is created to test NFT contracts and test Opensea's UX

## Expected Use Case
* Metadata    : Stored in IPFS
* Minter      : Only the owner of this contract
* MarketPlace : Opensea

## Contracts
* Based on ERC721 contract code from Openzeppelin
* Overwrite _baseURI() to make it easier to access IPFS (we should register only IPFS hash when mint NFTs)
* Overwrite isApprovedForAll() to enable Opensea to Transfer NFTs in this contract
* Only the owner of this contract can mint NFTs
* The owner can list URIs of all NFTs from this contract

## Setup
```
$ npm install
$ npx hardhat
```
1. apply to [Polygonscan API](https://polygonscan.com/register)
2. install [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=ja)
3. fill token to your wallet from [faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/) or CEX
4. run above codes
5. create `.env` file as below
